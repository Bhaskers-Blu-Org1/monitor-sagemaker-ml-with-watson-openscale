# Summary

In this Code Pattern, we will use data from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/) to create a logistic regression model using Amazon SageMaker. We will use AI OpenScale to bind the ML model deployed in the AWS cloud, create a subscription, and perform payload and feedback logging.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:

* Prepare data, train a model, and deploy using AWS SageMaker
* Score the model using sample scoring records and the scoring endpoint
* Setup AI OpenScale Data Mart
* Bind the SageMaker model to the AIOS Data Mart
* Add subscriptions to the Data Mart
* Enable payload logging and performance monitor for both subscribed assets
* Use Data Mart to access tables data via subscription

# Description

This pattern describes a method to use AI OpenScale and a SageMaker machine learning model .With AI OpenScale, we can monitor model quality and log payloads, regardless of where the model is hosted. In this case, we use the example of an AWS SageMaker model , which demonstrates the agnostic and open nature of AI OpenScale (AIOS).

IBM AI OpenScale is an open environment which enables organizations to automate and operationalize their AI.  OpenScale provides a powerful platform for managing AI and ML models on the IBM cloud, or wherever they may be deployed, offering these benefits:

Open by design: AI OpenScale allows monitoring and management of ML and DL models built using any frameworks or IDEs and deployed on any model hosting engine.

Drive fairer outcomes: AI OpenScale detects and helps mitigate model biases to highlight fairness issues. The platform provides plain text explanation of the data ranges which have been impacted by bias in the model, and visualizations helping data scientists and business users understand the impact on business outcomes. As biases are detected, AI OpenScale automatically creates a de-biased companion model that runs beside deployed model, thereby previewing the expected fairer outcomes to users without replacing the original.

Explain transactions: AI OpenScale helps enterprises bring transparency and auditability to AI-infused applications by generating explanations for individual transactions being scored, including the attributes that were used to make the prediction and weightage of each attribute.

Automate the creation of AI: Neural Network Synthesis (NeuNetS), available in this update as a beta, synthesizes neural networks by fundamentally architecting a custom design for a given data set. In the beta, NeuNetS will support image and text classification models. NeuNetS reduces the time and lowers the skill barrier required to design and train custom neural networks, thereby putting neural networks within the reach of non-technical subject matter experts, as well as making data scientists more productive.

# Flow

![](doc/source/images/architecture.png)

1. The developer creates a Jupyter Notebook, using data from the [UCI ML database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/wdbc.data).
2. The Jupyter Notebook is connected to a PostgreSQL database, which is used to store AI OpenScale data.
3. An ML model is created using AWS SageMaker, and deployed to the cloud.
4. AI Open Scale is used by the notebook to log payload and monitor performance.
